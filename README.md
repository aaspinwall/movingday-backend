Moving Day is an application that helps users to look for a place to live. I've moved countries a couple of times and everytime I do, I dread looking for a new place. I want to offer others a simple tool that filters out spam, notifies them of listings that match their search criteria and most importantly, gives them peace of mind during stressful times.

The website is live and it runs without the need of this package. Use it as a reference or build something cool with it ðŸ˜‰
